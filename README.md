# Bitplexo Project

Bitplexo is a prototype financial web app designed to showcase the capabilities of swapping fiat and crypto currencies, laying the foundations for a real implementation.

What sets this project apart from others in the same domain is the agnostic financial integrations approach it takes, allowing for both fiat swaps (banking connections) and crypto swaps (blockchain connections), as well as the ability to buy/sell crypto for fiat and viceversa.

The agnostic financial integrations approach is about creating a platform that is flexible and inclusive, allowing users to choose the financial systems that work best for them without imposing any biases or restrictions.

For the "fiat swap" capability, users can simply connect to their bank using a private key and public key infrastructure, with identifying information such as their name and email address included in a certificate file that needs to be uploaded for each login, followed by a password. There is no need for complicated authentication to a centralized system.

For the "crypto swap" capability, a Metamask login will be required to connect to the site's smart contract(s) and start swapping.

Initial setting for a "Buy/sell" capability has been also integrated.

By mixing up different technologies and interfaces, a neat web3 application can be brought to life without leaving behind the actual traditional system. In this scenario, we believe that a financial platform or bank could implement Bitplexo's idea in their daily forex and defi operations.

The semi-dynamic website is built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully responsive, well-structured, and organized.

The state of this current iteration should be considered an MVP for the main features.

Ultimately, we suggest the cohabitation of traditional banking systems and decentralized systems through a functional website, making the technology invisible to users while keeping it simple and applying user-centric design at all times.

Please note that this project is not available for public deployment; it is intended solely for learning and demonstration purposes, although it is ready for use.

A bank or financial platform has discovered the potential of decentralized technologies, including their impact on UX design. For their first iteration, they decided to showcase a real functional website to their users, demonstrating that traditional and revolutionary systems, such as blockchain, can truly coexist because it is necessary. The project took into account the legal, commercial, technological, and social challenges, especially those related to the latter.

Following the philosophy of making technology invisible to users, the project was designed to satisfy a financial platform's desires.

Currently, users are able to swap between fiat and crypto currencies through the platform. The bank can also sell crypto, which will then appear in the crypto section for swapping to other coins, or vice versa for fiat currencies.

Although this iteration is only meant to showcase the financial capabilities of the project, it remains useful and interactive through Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

Investors, stakeholders, and clients are fully satisfied with the Bitplexo project since they are interested in forex and defi. The project's ability to seamlessly integrate traditional and decentralized financial systems appeals to a diverse range of users and offers a more comprehensive and holistic financial experience.

These insights stem from comprehensive research, as evidenced by the accompanying table and graphic.
